Module 4: PyCitySchools

# Overview

The purpose of this exercise was to analyze a school district through a variety of metrics, from student performance to the impact of factors like school budgets and student population sizes. This specific anaylsis has been conducted to reevalute the results in light of apparent academic dishonesty amongst ninth graders at Thomas High School, which may have skewed the original results.
