# Module-4-School-District-Analysis
Module 4: PyCitySchools

# Overview

The purpose of this exercise was to analyze a school district through a variety of metrics, from student performance to the impact of factors like school budgets and student population sizes. This specific anaylsis has been conducted to reevalute the results in light of apparent academic dishonesty amongst ninth graders at Thomas High School, which may have skewed the original results.

# Results

* After disregarding the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School and determining a new student count for that school with which to conduct our analysis, the outcome of the district summary changed minimally. The results for the Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing in the district as a whole all decreased very slightly, some so little that no change is observed when the data is formatted to the tenths decimal place (as the module and challenge instructions indicate), as will be the case for most of the following results. Below are the original district summary and the updated district summary, respectfully:

* As with the district summary, the results for the Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing have all changed very slightly as a result of the change in data for Thomas High School. In this case, the formatting of the chart to a further decimal place allowes the miniscule differences between the original and updated analysis to be a bit more evident upon close inspection. All but the Average Reading Score (which increased by .047%) decreased slightly. Below are the original and updated per school summaries, respectfully:

* Relative to other schools, replacing the 9th grader's math and reading scores had no impact on Thomas High School's performance, as it ranked as the second highest school by Overall Passing Percentage in both the original and updated analysis. Below are the top 5 schools from the original and updated analysis, respectfully:

* Impacts of Thomas 9th grade exclusion on other outcomes:

    * The math and reading scores by grade see no change from the original except for the exclusion of the data for Thomas High School's 9th grade class, which is represented by 'nan'. The grades for 10th, 11th, and 12th grade remain unchanged. The updated math and reading scores by grade are shown below:

    * Due to the change in results being so small, when expressed to the tenth decimal place, the outcomes for scores by spending range are identical between the original and updated analyses, even though in reality the values differ very slightly (to a degree visible only with the hundredth or even thousandth decimal place). Below is the scores by spending range outcome for both the original and updated analyses (identical at the tenth, and in some cases no decimal place):

    * The same can be said for the results for scores by school size. The differences between the original and updated results are so small that they are invisible with the formatting recommending in the assignment and module. Below is the scores by school size outcome for both the original and updated analyses (identical at the tenth, and in some cases no decimal place):

    * For scores by school type, once again, the differences between the original and updated results are so small that they are invisible with the formatting recommending in the assignment and module. Below is the scores by school type outcome for both the original and updated analyses (identical at the tenth, and in some cases no decimal place):
